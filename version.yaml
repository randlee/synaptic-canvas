# Marketplace Platform Version (NOT package versions)
#
# This is the version of the Synaptic Canvas marketplace platform/CLI infrastructure itself.
# It is NOT the source of truth for individual package versions.
#
# Three-layer versioning system:
# 1. Marketplace Version (this file): Platform/CLI version (e.g., sc-install.py, registry format)
# 2. Package Version (manifest.yaml): Per-package version (independent for each package)
# 3. Artifact Version (frontmatter): Individual command/skill/agent version (synchronized with package)
#
# See: docs/versioning-strategy.md for complete versioning policy
#
# When to bump this version:
# - Major changes to installation system or marketplace infrastructure
# - Breaking changes to registry format
# - New marketplace-wide features
#
# Package versions are managed independently in packages/*/manifest.yaml
#
version: "0.7.0"
