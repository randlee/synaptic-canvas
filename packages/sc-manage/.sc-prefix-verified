# SC-Prefix Verification

Date: 2025-12-04
Status: VERIFIED

All artifacts in the sc-manage package use consistent sc- prefix naming:
- Command: sc-manage.md
- Agents: sc-package-*.md, sc-packages-list.md
- Package name: sc-manage
- All manifest and registry references: correct

No changes were needed; package was already compliant.
